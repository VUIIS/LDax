===

You can find the tutorial on how to install the two data-types for DAX [here](https://github.com/VUIIS/dax/wiki/DAX-XNAT-Data-types-Installation).

You can find the jar_files for XNAT version 1.6.x and 1.7.x in each respectiv folder. XNAT 1.7 is using graddle to generate datatypes now.
You can look at the code present in each default and freesurfer folder for 1.7 to see the graddle requirement to build a jar file.
